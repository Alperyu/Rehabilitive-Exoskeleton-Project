The projects is about to construct a lower limb exoskeleton robot for rehabilitive purposes. 
The simulation was carried out in CoppeliaSim and it was supported by MATLAB. 
The exoskeleton robot was designed based on the ASTI humanoid model and was configured to support the walking of paralyzed individuals. 
A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained in MATLAB to analyze the humanoid's gait, estimate an appropriate torque limit, and apply that limit to the exoskeleton to perform an efficient physiotherapy simulation.
Denavit-Hartenberg table was created. Jacobian Matrice and the other matrices of the dynamic equation were calculated in MATLAB.
